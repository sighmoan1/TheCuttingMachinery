# The Cutting Machinery

[The Cutting Machinery](http://thecuttingmachinery.com/) was a meditation app which taught a very simple, fairly stable, introductory meditation technique for people who are serious about getting to enlightenment. The technique was developed by [Vinay Gupta](https://twitter.com/leashless) of [The Hexayurt Project](http://hexayurt.com/).

The app stopped being available for obscure reasons, and the audio files were made available for download.

Due to the invention of [Flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)) and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4), an app user with no software development experience was able to create a version of the app - and here it is in this repo. 

If you want to support Vinay's work, build a hexayurt. If you want to support the app user's work, donate to [Action for Child Trauma International](https://actinternational.org.uk/).
