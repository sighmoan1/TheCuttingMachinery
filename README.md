# The Cutting Machinery

[The Cutting Machinery](http://thecuttingmachinery.com/) was a meditation app which taught a very simple, fairly stable, introductory meditation technique for people who are serious about getting to enlightenment. The technique was developed by [Vinay Gupta](https://twitter.com/leashless) of [The Hexayurt Project](http://hexayurt.com/).

The app stopped being available and the audio files were made available for download. I've made a worse version of the app that can still be used.
